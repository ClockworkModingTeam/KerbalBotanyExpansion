    RESULTS
    {
        KerbinSrfLanded = By Simply Looking Outside of the Capsule, you see that there are many GeKePs growing anyway, you take note of what they look like in true botany fashion: green, and planty
        KerbinFlyingLow = Flying plants look like plants on the ground, but more fly-y.
        KerbinFlyingHigh = You wonder what the GeKeP would look like outside the window
        KerbinInSpaceLow = The plant is much more floaty now, and the roots don't know where to grow
        KerbinInSpace = The plants miss the ideal mix of gasses on Kerbin, they look a little sad.
